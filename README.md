# Basic ERC721 Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic ERC721 Smart contract using Hardhat. It comes with a Vanar contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
